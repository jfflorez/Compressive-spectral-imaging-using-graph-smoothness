## Spectral image reconstrution for compressive spectral imaging using smoothness on graphs

This repository contains both real and simulated datasets to test the methods and reproduce the results of our paper:

1. **Block-based spectral image reconstruction using smoothness on graphs.**

Python implementations of reconstruction methods and usage examples are still being refined so please check constantly for updates.
